all the games are in games folder .
all the images that we require for games are in pypics folder
I have made all the games in codeskulptor using python and simple gui

Q)How to run a game 
A)	S1)go to firefox browser and go to http://www.codeskulptor.org/ and save that page to your local computer
	S2)open the game and copy paste that code in codeskulptor that is in your local machine
	S3)the games are dependent on the images and all the images are in pypics folder
	   so when you copy paste code of the game just see if you are importing any images
   	   if you importing some image thing then change its path to the curent path of that image in your local machine
	S4)just press the run button on the upper left corner . It press first button were there are 5 buttons.
	S5)game started
